    <string name="about_app">This is Four Fours, a simple math game where the goal is to create any
        number you choose using only 4 of number and a limited set of mathematical operations. Try
        to solve as many as possible, and see how how many times the number has been gotten by everyone 
        with the app as well.\n\n

        This app was created in under 24 hours at CodeDay Spring 2018 by Robert Marzec, with help
        from Joshua Garza.\n\n
