    <string name="about_app">This game was created in under 24 hours by three people using Android Studio
    and Firebase. The objective of the game is to create any number using four fours and mathematical
    operations. Using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, it is possible to
    create all numbers from 0-10 using four fours. After that, numbers require more complex operators
    such as square roots, exponents, factorials, decimal points, concatenation, and more.</string>
